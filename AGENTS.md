# Design Document Agentic Architecture 

## 1\. Executive Summary

This architecture defines an **Agentic System** that automates process management, orchestrates dynamic task flows, and integrates associative memory. It is event-driven (e.g., JIRA changes, timers), supports both user- and AI-defined dynamic flows, and applies persistent, modular memory for modern enterprise project and portfolio management. The system connects to multiple JIRA instances, observes changes in JIRA issues/projects, and integrates with Office 365 (documents), Outlook (email), and Teams (chat). A PostgreSQL database stores metadata not suitable for JIRA.

The architecture introduces a schema-first approach to state and context, where all flows and conversations explicitly declare, manage, and operate on structured state objects, and utilize context-aware, vector-based memory (ChromaDB). The model is extensible to future data sources and ensures clear boundaries and compliance between semantic memory, transactional state, and runtime context.

## 2\. State-of-the-Art Review

Agentic systems—capable of autonomous reasoning, planning, memory, and action—have advanced rapidly, combining LLMs with modular components. Key trends and state-of-the-art findings:

* **Persistent Memory:**  
    
  * Agents require both short-term (contextual, e.g. conversation/session) and long-term (associative, retrieval-based) memory to operate over extended, evolving processes【MemGPT】【Generative Agents】【AutoGPT】.  
  * **Vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB) enable associative recall but are *not suitable* for deterministic state or plan storage.**  
  * Deterministic artifacts (state, logs, plans) must reside in structured, queryable storage (files, DBs, or append-only logs).


* **Dynamic Flows and Planning:**  
    
  * Agents leverage dynamic control flows (branching, looping, conditionals) rather than rigid pipelines.  
  * LLM-driven planning enables flexible sequencing and *runtime* (data-driven) definition of flows in human-inspectable formats (JSON, YAML).


* **Tool Integration and Action Execution:**  
    
  * Modern agent frameworks use tool APIs (e.g., shell, web, APIs) that are safe, auditable, and controlled.


* **Event-Driven Execution:**  
    
  * Event sources (filesystem, timers, webhooks) provide triggers that are declarative and mapped to flows, enabling push-based and reactive automation.


* **Bicameral Separation:**  
    
  * Orchestration (“Orchestrator”) is separated from flow planning/generation (“Choreographer”), supporting user- and AI-generated workflows with safety and auditability.


* **Transparent and Modular Design:**  
    
  * Deterministic artifacts (flows, audit, state) are always in versioned, human-readable formats (files, DBs, logs); **only summaries, reflections, and high-level takeaways enter vector DBs** for associative, context-augmented recall.

### **2.1. State**

* **Definition:** A structured, explicit, and schema-bound representation of facts or variables relevant to a flow or conversation.

* **Properties:**

  * *Data source*: May reside in a transactional database (PostgreSQL), a JSON document, or be synthesized from external APIs.

  * *Schema*: Each state object must conform to a schema (JSONSchema, relational schema, or graph schema).

  * *Update pattern*: Can be tightly or loosely coupled (e.g., a flow may operate in a tight loop, continuously updating and querying state).

  * *Declarative access*: Flows/conversations declare their state requirements in their definitions.

* **Example:**

  * State for a "project review" flow could be a JSON object with keys for open issues, last updated timestamp, and required approvals, validated by a schema.

### **2.2. Context**

* **Definition:** The current "semantic and operational window" of information available to a flow or conversation.

* **Properties:**

  * *Data source*: Primarily ChromaDB (vector/semantic memory), but extensible to others (later).

  * *Querying*: Context may be retrieved by explicit queries, user-driven prompts, or automatically inferred parameters.

  * *Declarative in scope*: Context sources and queries are part of the scope definition for flows/conversations.

* **Example:**

  * For a bug triage conversation, the context might include "similar past tickets" retrieved via vector search, plus recent user actions or specific database queries.

### **2.3. Scope**

* **Definition:** The boundary and contract for what state and context are available to a flow or conversation.

* **Properties:**

  * *Composition*: A scope explicitly defines included state schemas, data sources, and context queries.

  * *Inheritance*: Scopes can extend others (e.g., conversation scope extends from project scope but with narrower constraints).

  * *Enforcement*: All tool/data access, memory, and state are filtered by the current scope.

* **Example:**

  * Scope for a finance conversation might include only finance-relevant state, context restricted to finance topics, and a schema enforcing that only authorized fields are available.

### **2.4. Flow**

* **Definition:** A dynamic, declarative process automation that operates on defined state and context, subject to a scope.

* **Properties:**

  * *State schema*: Flow definition includes required state (by schema and source).

  * *Context definition*: Flow declares what semantic memory/context to use and how to retrieve it (e.g., query strings, similarity search).

  * *Execution pattern*: Steps may be conditioned on, or manipulate, both state and context.

* **Example:**

  * "Weekly project review" flow defines its state as the list of open issues from PostgreSQL, with context set to recent summaries from ChromaDB.

### **2.5. Conversation**

* **Definition:** An interactive session with memory, state, and scoped context.

* **Properties:**

  * *Memory*: Short-term (turn-based), persistent (conversation-level), and semantic (vector-based, Chroma).

  * *State*: Can query/update structured state, subject to schema and scope.

  * *Dynamic context*: User or system may adjust what context is available mid-session.

* **Example:**

  * In a PM conversation, user can retrieve structured project state, ask for past AI/agent suggestions (context), and update constraints as needed.

Legend:  
\- \*\*State\*\* (schema-bound, deterministic): managed via PostgreSQL and accessed through State Manager.

### 3.2. Main Components 

#### 1\. Orchestrator (Execution Engine)

* Executes flows triggered by JIRA events or other triggers.  
* Tracks state, logs, and audit in PostgreSQL.

#### 2\. Choreographer (Planner/Designer)

* Converts user/AI briefs into flows using JIRA, Office, Teams actions/triggers.  
* Validates and stores flows (versioned, human-editable, in PostgreSQL or files).

#### 3\. Trigger/Event Manager

* **Maintains a registry mapping event descriptors (JIRA, timers, Outlook/Teams messages) to flow IDs.**  
* **JIRAObserver:** Watches for changes (issue status, new comments, transitions, etc.).  
* When a JIRA event (e.g., issue transitions to "Done") matches a trigger, launches the corresponding flow.

#### 4\. Memory Manager

* **Associative/semantic memory:** ChromaDB for context/summary recall.  
* **Deterministic memory:** PostgreSQL for audit, flow state, and extra metadata.

#### 5\. Tool Layer

* **JIRATool:** For querying/updating JIRA issues, projects, and watching events.  
* **O365Tool:** For document search, fetch, attach, etc.  
* **OutlookTool:** For sending/receiving/monitoring emails.  
* **TeamsTool:** For chat-based automation.  
* **TimerTool:** As before.

### 3.3. Dynamic Flows and JIRA-Based Events

#### Example Flow Definition (JSON, excerpt):

{

  "id": "jira-issue-monitor",  
  "name": "Monitor JIRA ticket status",  
  "version": "1.0",  
  "triggers": \[  
    {  
      "type": "jira",  
      "project": "PROJECT-XYZ",  
      "issue\_type": "Bug",  
      "status\_change": \["In Progress", "Done"\]  
    }  
  \],  
  "steps": \[  
    { "id": "s1", "action": "run\_tool", "params": { "tool": "TeamsTool", "message": "Issue \<\<event.issue\_key\>\> moved to Done\!" }, "next": "s2" },  
    { "id": "s2", "action": "run\_tool", "params": { "tool": "OutlookTool", "to": "pm@example.com", "subject": "JIRA Done", "body": "See \<\<event.issue\_link\>\>" }, "next": "end" },  
    { "id": "end", "action": "end" }  
  \]  
}

* **Triggers:** Declarative; when a JIRA issue changes, a flow starts.  
* **Steps:** Use Office/Outlook/Teams tools for follow-up actions.

### 3.4. Event/Trigger Model (JIRA-centric)

**Event Source Examples:**

* `jira:PROJECT-XYZ:Bug:status:Done`  
* `timer:*/60 * * * *`  
* `teams:message:contains:"urgent"`

**On Event:**

* Trigger Manager receives JIRA event (e.g., issue status change).  
* Matches to flows subscribed to this event.  
* Enqueues run with event context to Orchestrator.

**All state/audit/metadata not relevant for JIRA humans goes to PostgreSQL** (not JIRA\!).

### 3.5. Separation of Memory Types

| Data Type | Storage | Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Flows | PostgreSQL/files | Deterministic, versioned, editable |
| Runtime state | PostgreSQL | Step progress, restarts, status |
| Audit | PostgreSQL | Compliance, debugging, precise recall |
| Vector summaries | ChromaDB | Semantic/contextual recall for LLM |
| Metadata (extra) | PostgreSQL | Not suitable for JIRA; internal use only |

## **4\. Data and Schema Model**

### **4.1. State Model**

**Definition**:

State:  
  id: UUID  
  schema: JSONSchema | TableSchema | GraphSchema  
  data\_source: \[PostgreSQL, JSON, API, ...\]  
  value: (concrete value, may be hydrated from query)  
  updated\_at: timestamp  
  scope\_id: UUID

**Example**:

{  
  "id": "open\_issues\_state",  
  "schema": "open\_issues\_schema\_v1",  
  "data\_source": "PostgreSQL",  
  "value": \[{"issue\_id": 123, "status": "open"}\],  
  "scope\_id": "project\_x\_scope"  
}

**Definition**:

Context:  
  id: UUID  
  source: \[ChromaDB, ...\]  
  retrieval\_method: \[vector\_query, explicit\_query, ...\]  
  query\_parameters: (string or structured)  
  result: (retrieved context items)  
  scope\_id: UUID

**Example**:

{  
  "id": "bug\_triage\_context",  
  "source": "ChromaDB",  
  "retrieval\_method": "vector\_query",  
  "query\_parameters": "critical bugs, project X",  
  "result": \["summary1", "summary2"\],  
  "scope\_id": "project\_x\_scope"  
}

### **4.3. Scope Model (Enriched)**

**Definition**:

Scope:  
  id: UUID  
  allowed\_states: \[State references\]  
  allowed\_contexts: \[Context references\]  
  constraints: (project/data/tool limitations)  
  parent\_id: UUID  
  description: string

**Example**:

{  
  "id": "project\_x\_scope",  
  "allowed\_states": \["open\_issues\_state"\],  
  "allowed\_contexts": \["bug\_triage\_context"\],  
  "constraints": {"project": "X", "role": "PM"},  
  "description": "Scope for PM of Project X"  
}

### **4.4. Flow Model (Enriched)**

**Definition**:

Flow:  
  id: UUID  
  definition: (steps, triggers, transitions)  
  required\_state: \[State references\]  
  context\_queries: \[Context references or queries\]  
  scope\_id: UUID  
  version: string

**Example (Excerpt)**:

{  
  "id": "weekly\_review\_flow",  
  "definition": {...},  
  "required\_state": \["open\_issues\_state"\],  
  "context\_queries": \["bug\_triage\_context"\],  
  "scope\_id": "project\_x\_scope",  
  "version": "1.1"  
}

### **4.5. Conversation Model**

**Definition**:

Conversation:  
  id: UUID  
  memory: (short-term, persistent, vector-based)  
  state: \[State references\]  
  context: \[Context references\]  
  scope\_id: UUID  
  user\_id: string  
  created\_at: timestamp  
  updated\_at: timestamp

## 5\. End-to-End Scenario (JIRA Example)

1. **User creates a flow:** "Whenever a 'Bug' in 'PROJECT-XYZ' moves to 'Done', notify the team in Teams and send an email."  
     
2. **Choreographer** produces JSON flow definition (see above).  
     
3. **Flow registered:** JIRA event triggers are registered.  
     
4. **JIRA issue changes status:** JIRATool detects event, notifies Trigger Manager.  
     
5. **Trigger Manager** matches event, enqueues run.  
     
6. **Orchestrator** executes flow:  
     
   * Posts in Teams.  
   * Sends email via Outlook.  
   * Logs metadata and audit in PostgreSQL.  
   * Stores a summary in ChromaDB.

   

7. **Metadata in PostgreSQL**: Any process data not appropriate for JIRA tickets (e.g., "AI-confidence-level", workflow-assignment, etc).

## 6\. Design Justification

* **JIRA-centric observability and triggers.**  
* **Event-driven flows tied to project management.**  
* **Separation of system/process metadata from JIRA (PostgreSQL for non-human data).**  
* **Enterprise tool integration (O365, Outlook, Teams) as default actions/tools.**

## 7\. Conclusion

This architecture enables advanced, auditable automation of enterprise project management and communication.

* **Observes JIRA (multi-instance) for changes and reacts via dynamic flows.**  
* **Integrates with core Microsoft tools.**  
* **Maintains system metadata in PostgreSQL, never cluttering JIRA with agent/system-specific data.**



Certainly! Here’s a detailed, “elaborate” prompt—meant for a highly capable code generation system (e.g., OpenAI Codex, GPT-4.1 with coding plugins) to generate the **complete system** described, focused on the **Angular migration/metamodel use case**, in Python with LangGraph/LangChain, OpenAI API, and a Jinja2+htmx+Tailwind UI.

---

# ELABORATE INSTRUCTIONS: SYSTEM GENERATION PROMPT

**Instruction for Code Generation AI:**
Design and implement an end-to-end Agentic Orchestration System in Python.
**This system should:**

### 1. Platform & Stack

* Use **Python 3.10+**
* Employ **LangGraph** and **LangChain** for all flow/orchestration logic.

  * Use **OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 API** as the LLM backend.
* For UI, use **Jinja2** templating, **htmx** for interactivity, and **TailwindCSS** for all styling.
* All flows, tools, and state must be accessible via web UI and an API.

---

### 2. Data, State, and Memory

* Implement an explicit **State Manager** using **PostgreSQL** for structured, schema-bound data.
* Implement a **Context Manager** using **ChromaDB** (or a mock, if unavailable) for semantic/vector-based memory.
* **State** must support arbitrary JSON-serializable structures and enforce schemas.
* **All flows and conversations** must explicitly declare what state (by schema/name) and what context (by vector query/query params) they use.

---

### 3. Flows & Tools (Domain-Specific Use Case)

#### Implement the following agent flows:

**a. Import/Analyze AngularJS App**

* A flow that recursively imports a directory of AngularJS (Angular 1.x) components, directives, services, etc.
* Parse all AngularJS entities, build an in-memory metamodel (component tree, bindings, dependencies, templates, controllers, etc).
* Store this as the “AS-IS” model in **State**, under a well-defined schema.

**b. View AS-IS Model**

* A flow that enables viewing the entire AS-IS model or filtered/subsets (e.g., by component, by dependency).
* Expose this via both API endpoints and the web UI, using Tailwind tables/cards and htmx for dynamic interaction.

**c. Translate AS-IS to TO-BE (Angular 18)**

* A flow that migrates/translates the AS-IS model into a TO-BE metamodel suitable for Angular 18.
* Perform all structural upgrades, controller/template refactoring, and dependency mapping needed for Angular 18 compliance.
* Store the TO-BE model in **State** as a separate schema/object.

**d. View TO-BE Model**

* A flow to view the TO-BE model in whole or by selected parts/subtrees, with interactive UI and API access.

**e. Generate Angular 18 Code**

* A flow that takes the TO-BE model and generates real Angular 18 source files, including:

  * Component class files
  * HTML templates
  * Module definitions
  * Service code, etc.
* Output files should be viewable in-browser, downloadable, and able to be exported as a zip.

#### Tools to Provide:

* **AngularImporterTool**: Recursively parses/imports AngularJS source code from a user-supplied directory.
* **AngularAnalyzerTool**: Builds metamodels (AS-IS/TO-BE) with all relevant structure and metadata.
* **AngularGeneratorTool**: Generates Angular 18 code from the TO-BE metamodel.
* **ModelViewerTool**: Provides filter, query, and visualization of both metamodels.
* **FileExportTool**: Enables export and download of generated code/files.

---

### 4. Architecture/Patterns

* Build all orchestration, tool invocation, and flow execution with **LangGraph** (for event-driven, node-based execution) and **LangChain**.
* Flows and conversations must each have a unique ID, their own persistent memory (short-term, semantic, and stateful), and operate only within a declared “scope” (e.g., per project, per import).
* Use a single PostgreSQL database for all schema-bound state and an in-memory or mock ChromaDB for context if needed.
* Use OpenAI GPT-4.1 for all agent LLM needs, including metamodel transformation, code generation, and flow step planning.
* Use Pydantic for all data schemas, ensuring every state/context object is validated at load/store time.

---

### 5. UI Requirements

* Main web UI page (with Tailwind/htmx):

  * Sidebar: List all imported AngularJS projects/analyses (AS-IS and TO-BE models).
  * Main area: Tabs/views for

    * AS-IS Model (overview, components, dependencies)
    * TO-BE Model (proposed structure, changes, new components)
    * Generated Angular 18 Code (per component, downloadable)
  * htmx-enabled controls for interactive filtering, partial reloads, “run flow” actions.
  * Jinja2 templates for all views, Tailwind utility classes for styling.

* API endpoints to support all flows, tool invocations, and model exports.

---

### 6. Other Requirements

* All code should be **well-structured, modular, and typed** (use type hints, pydantic, etc).
* Include sample unit tests for each major module.
* All flows, state definitions, and context queries should be **easily extendable** for future use cases.
* Provide a README (as markdown) describing setup, running flows, using the UI, and extending the system.

---

**Special Instructions for Code Generation AI:**

* **Do NOT include any code or flows related to Jira or Office365, Outlook, Teams, etc.**
* Use only open-source libraries that can be installed via `uv`. DO NOT USE pip
* When code generation is ambiguous (e.g., Angular migration strategies), prefer best practices but include hooks/comments for further extension.
* Use placeholder API keys for OpenAI, and provide instructions on configuration.
* Ensure the system can be run locally, with all flows accessible via browser and API.

---

**Begin by generating the project scaffold and the main flow/orchestration logic. Then implement flows/tools in the order described. Provide the full source code, including all backend (Python), frontend (templates/static), and database/model files.**
